We introduce SeaLLMs - a family of language models optimized for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages. The SeaLLM-base models (to be released) were pre-trained from [Llama-2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf), on a tailored publicly-available dataset, which comprises texts in Vietnamese üáªüá≥, Indonesian üáÆüá©, Thai üáπüá≠, Malay üá≤üáæ, Khmerüá∞üá≠, Laoüá±üá¶, Tagalogüáµüá≠ and Burmeseüá≤üá≤. The [SeaLLM-chat](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SeaLLMs/SeaLLM-Chat-13b) underwent supervised finetuning (SFT) and specialized self-preferencing DPO using a mix of public instruction data and a small number of queries used by SEA language native speakers in natural settings, which **adapt to the local cultural norms, customs, styles and laws in these areas**. 

SeaLLM-13b models exhibit superior performance across a wide spectrum of linguistic tasks and assistant-style instruction-following capabilities relative to comparable open-source models. Moreover, they outperform **ChatGPT-3.5** in non-Latin languages, such as Thai, Khmer, Lao, and Burmese.

The following sections summarize the [performance evaluations](#evaluation) of SeaLLMs and the [training process](#training-process).


## Evaluation


### Sea-bench Peer Comparison

One of the most reliable ways to compare chatbot models is peer comparison. 
With the help of native speakers, we built an instruction test set, called [Sea-bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SeaLLMs/Sea-bench) that focuses on various aspects expected in a user-facing chatbot, namely:
(1) task-solving (e.g. translation & comprehension), 
(2) math-reasoning (e.g., math and logical reasoning questions), 
(3) general-instruction (e.g., instructions in general domains),
(4) natural-questions (e.g., questions about local context often written informally), and
(5) safety-related questions.
The test set also covers all languages that we are concerned with.
Similar to [MT-bench](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/mt-bench), We use **GPT-4** as an evaluator to rate the comparison between our models versus ChatGPT-3.5 and other baselines.

We evaluate Sea-bench in 2 mode: Score-based grading (0 to 10) and Peer comparison.

![fig_sea_bench_side_by_side.png](img/fig_sea_bench_side_by_side.png)

As shown in the figure above, as aggregated by task category (left radar chart), our SeaLLM-13b model performs on-par or surpasses ChatGPT-3.5 across many linguistic and writing tasks. This is despite [reported evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17012) that GPT-4 evaluator may favor ChatGPT more often than humans do. 

Comparing instruction-following capabilities of models in the angle of different SEA languages. As shown, SeaLLM-13b outperforms ChatGPT-3.5 by large margins in most non-Latin languages, such as Burmese (Mya), Lao, Khmer and Thai. In combination with the fact that SeaLLM can encode these languages with up to 9 times fewer tokens, our models are not only superior but also cheaper to operate in these languages than ChatGPT. This helps democratize the benefits of large language models to under-represented and potentially developing communities.

    <img src="img/seallm10l_vs_chatgpt_by_cat.png" alt="Snow" style="float: left; width: 48%">
</div>


We also compare our model head-on with ChatGPT in peer comparison, as seen above. SeaLLM-13b is equal or better than ChatGPT for up to 40% of the times for Latin-based languages (Eng, Vie, Ind, Msa). In contrast, for non-Latin languages, our SeaLLM-13b surpasses ChatGPT by up to 90%.

### Safety Enchancement in Local Context

There is growing [evidence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06474.pdf) that western-built LLMs often neglect safety protection in many lower-resource languages, or even promote contents that may be locally perceived as harmful, inappropriate or illegal by local norms and laws. We take efforts in adapting and safeguarding our SeaLLM models to achieve greater adoption and compliance for the regional audience of Southeast Asia.

The below dropdown table showcases examples of potentially harmful content that ChatGPT generates whereas our model behaves safer and complies with the regulations.

### M3Exam - World Knowledge in Regional Languages


[M3Exam](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05179.pdf) is a collection of real-life and native official human exam question benchmarks. This benchmark covers questions from multiple countries in the SEA region, which require strong multilingual proficiency and cultural knowledge across various critical educational periods, from primary- to high-school levels of difficulty.

As shown in the table, our SeaLLM model outperforms most 13B baselines and reaches closer to ChatGPT's performance. 
Notably, for Thai - a seemingly low-resource language, our model is just 1% behind ChatGPT despite the large size difference.


| M3Exam / 3-shot (Acc) | En | Zh | Vi | Id | Th

### MMLU - Preserving English-based knowledge

On the 5-shot [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300), our SeaLLM models not only preserve but also slightly outperform 13B LLama-2 and Llama-2-chat, despite the fact that optimizing for this English dominant test set is not part of our goal.

| MMLU (Acc) | Average
|----------- | ------- | 
| Llama-2-7b-chat  | 45.62
| Llama-2-13b-chat | 53.50
| SeaLLM-7b        | 47.16
| SeaLLM-13b-5L    | 55.23
| SeaLLM-13b-10L   | 52.68


### Machine Translation

![fig_translate](img/fig_translation.png)

We use the [Flores-200](https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/flores) to to test our models ability in machine translation. As shown in above figure, SeaLLM-13B exhibits clear superiority over ChatGPT-3.5 in low-resource languages, such as Lao and Khmer, while maintaining comparable performance with ChatGPT-3.5 in most high-resource languages (e.g., Vietnamese and Indonesian). 



## Training process

### Vocabulary Expansion
Like many English/Latin-dominant LLMs, Llama-2's BPE tokenizer breaks non-European and non-Latin linguistic texts into unsustainably long byte-level sequences that cover much shorter semantic meanings, leading to [degraded performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11372). For instance, it takes 4.3x more tokens to encode the same sentence in Thai compared to that in English (see below table). This leads to the models failing to perform tasks requiring long context modeling.

Our goal for vocabulary expansion is threefold: (1) the number of newly-added tokens must be minimal and only cover the new languages, (2) the tokens should bring the compression ratios of new languages close to that of English, and (3) minimize the disruption of existing European tokens to preserve Llama-2 knowledge. In the end, we obtain **~16K** new tokens from SEA languages to augment the original 32K-token vocabulary. Our expansion technique is detailed in our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00738.pdf).

As seen in the table below, our new vocabulary reduces the compression ratio from 4.29 to 1.57 for Thai - meaning it can now encode 2.7x longer Thai text given the same context length.

|Language | ChatGPT's ratio | Llama's ratio | Our ratio 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Vie |  4.41 |  3.46 | 1.48 
| Zho |  2.80 |  2.36 | 1.40 
| Tha |  9.09 |  5.10 | 1.87 
| Ind |  2.00 |  2.09 | 1.36 
| Khm | 15.56 | 12.14 | 2.67 
| Lao | 13.29 | 13.50 | 2.07 
| Msa |  2.07 |  2.16 | 1.50 
| Mya | 17.11 |  9.85 | 1.93 
| Tgl |  2.28 |  2.22 | 1.91 
| Eng |  1.00 (baseline) |  1.19 | 1.19 


### Pre-training Data

The pre-training dataset of SeaLLMs is formed by the documents from diverse public sources, including web texts (e.g., [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/)), 
news documents (e.g., [CC-News](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cc_news)), academic articles, and texts with expert knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia). 
We firstly employ [FastText language indentifier](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification) to filter out the documents that do not belong to SEA languages. 
To further remove harmful or undesirable content, we develop a pipeline with various data cleaning and filtering modules to preprocess the collected data. 
Meanwhile, to maintain the English performance of SeaLLMs, we also introduce a set of high-quality English texts sampled from [RedPajama-Data](https://github.com/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data) into pre-training. 

### Pre-training Strategies

We conduct pre-training in multiple stages. Each stage serves a different specific objective and involves dynamic control of (unsupervised and supervised) data mixture, as well as data specification and categorization. We also employ novel sequence construction and masking techniques during these stages. Details are provided in the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00738.pdf).

### Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) Data

Our supervised finetuning (SFT) data consists of many categories. The largest and most dominant of them are public and open-source. As the aforementioned are English only, we employ several established automatic techniques to gather more instruction data for SEA languages through synthetic means. For a small number of SFT data, we engaged native speakers to vet, verify and modify SFT responses so that they adapt to the local cultural customs, norms, and laws.
We also collect country-relevant safety data that cover many culturally and legally sensitive topics in each of these SEA countries - such data tend to be ignored, or may even appear in conflict with Western safety data. Therefore, we believe that our models are more local-friendly and abide by local rules to a higher degree.

### SFT Strategies

We conduct SFT with a relatively balanced mix of SFT data from different categories. We make use of the system prompt during training, as we found it helps induce a prior which conditions the model to a behavioral distribution that focuses on safety and usefulness. Details are provided in the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00738.pdf).

### Self-preferencing DPO

To save the cost of human preference annotation work, [some](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta) have sought to use powerful LLMs like GPT-4 to play as a preference data generator. However, that may not even be feasible for low-resource non-Latin languages because of the unfavorable tokenization of ChatGPT as explained above. In other words, even short prompts would exceed their context-length and the API-call costs would explode by up to 17 times.

Therefore, we use our own SeaLLM SFT models to generate preference data using a special prompting strategy, which we later use to employ direct preference optimization (DPO) to significantly improve the model abilities as an AI agent. As such, our models are free from relying on powerful close-sourced models like GPT-4 to improve the performance in low-resource languages.
